"Name": "Topi Antelope Display their Unique Mating Behaviors",
"Overview": "Topi antelopes begin to show their mating behavior with specialized snorting and chasing.  Topis are natives of African savannas. They live in small herds. Both males and females have horns so you have to look carefully to sex them.\r\n\r\nIt is the beginning of breeding season and the males are starting their displays using a high-stepping, specialized prancing, a \"rocking canter,\" that is unique to this species.  The chasing and displaying will get more intense as the breeding season progresses with males establishing small, temporary territories into which they shepherd as many females as they can.  But for now, the males are just practicing and with the increasing heat of the afternoon, most of the herd switches to resting.   "

"Overview": "A large great barracuda comes to a cleaning station to have its external parasites removed and injuries “doctored” by thumb-sized bluestreak cleaner wrasses.\r\n\r\nCleaner wrasses concentrate at isolated coral heads that become cleaning stations for large and small fishes alike.  The small blue and black wrasses swim around the barracuda, at times entering the gills and even the open mouth of the big fish.  The cleaner fish bumps the barracuda’s lower jaw to stimulate it to open its mouth allowing the cleaner to swim inside and clean around the large jagged teeth.  "

"Name": "Andean Bears  - Watch Them Squeal and Squabble Over Food!",
"Overview": "Andean bears feast on treats and squabble over food.\r\n\r\nAndean bears are also known as spectacled bears due to the distinctive white or light fur markings around their eyes which can resemble eyeglasses or spectacles.\r\n\r\nThey exhibit both cooperative and competitive feeding behaviors in the wild and use a variety of vocalizations to communicate with one another. These sounds include huffs, snorts and even a unique humming sound. These vocal behaviors play a crucial role in establishing social bonds, expressing emotions and signaling territorial or defensive intentions within their complex social dynamics."

"Overview": "A jaguar prowls along a riverbank in the Pantanal region of Brazil.\r\n\r\nJaguars are the largest felines native to the Americas and are known as skillful hunters. They live in a variety of habitats in Brazil, including forests, grasslands and wetlands. These semi-aquatic cats use their powerful legs and sharp claws to ambush prey, including caimans, capybaras and deer.\r\n\r\nJaguars are the top predator in the Pantanal and play a crucial role in maintaining a balanced ecosystem. With the highest density of jaguars in the world, this region is an important refuge for these animals, offering a unique opportunity for conservation and research."

Dagga boys which tend to be very old males who are no longer competitive, are isolated animals and therefore adopt an extremely aggressive stance toward threats and are considered quite dangerous. \r\n\r\n"

The Falkland's sea lion population was decimated by commercial hunters. Down to to 4% of historical numbers, it has never recovered though hunting was stopped in the 1950s. One possible reason is warming local seawater temperatures, due to climate change, which may be reducing food availability and the ability of females to properly feed their nursing pups.\r\n\r\n"

"Overview": "Black vultures feeding at this nest are helping the turtle. The black vulture is a scavenger and feeds almost exclusively on carrion. They use their sharp eyes to locate food and regularly patrol beaches for dead animals washed up on shore. Where turtles are nesting, they are quick to locate nests that have been disturbed by predators. The birds are not known to harm intact nests. Cleaning up destroyed nests may help reduce infestations of fly maggots that destroy healthy intact nests.\r\n\r\nThis video was collected in collaboration with Osa Conservation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting the globally significant biodiversity of the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is to help convince the others that he has dominance. \r\n\r\nIt is believed to be a means of impressing females to mate with him. Studies have shown that those who shine brightest attract the most females. The color is not a pigment. It is caused by the refraction of light (as with rainbows) by highly organized cells on the outside of the scrotum. The females are using brightness as an indicator of overall genetic quality. \r\n\r\n"

Black bears are omnivores and their diet consists mainly of herbs, grasses, insects and fruits but will occasionally be supplemented by fish or other meat. Black bears typically only consume meat when more preferred foods are scarce."

In Mexico, American black bears inhabit plant communities dominated by deciduous and evergreen oaks and montane chaparral. Their diets vary seasonally with food availability. In springtime, grasses and forbs make up the bulk of the American black bear's caloric intake, with berries and insects being preferred during summer. In the fall, the bears feed primarily on acorns and other nuts before hibernation. "

Prairie dogs are susceptible to the Sylvatic Plague, which is transmitted by fleas and is a bacterial disease that affects many other mammal species. All four species in the United States are at risk of contracting the disease, with prairie dogs suffering an extremely high mortality rate at or above 90 percent. Many species depend on the prairie dog's survival as it is a keystone species and an indicator of an ecosystem's overall health.\r\n\r\n"

They only need to cut meat into smaller sections to swallow. Their teeth are so specialized for cutting meat that they can’t crush the tougher parts of an animal like bone or cartilage. A lion’s tongue is covered in tiny spines, which face backwards, and are used to scrape meat from bones. "

Lions are apex predators, as they help regulate the populations of other animals such as herbivores and other species. If one prey species becomes too abundant, it can make an entire ecosystem unhealthy. Grasses and other food will become less abundant for all other species to thrive.  Scientists believe that healthy predator populations help maintain functioning ecosystems."

"Overview": "A marabou stork defends a kudu carcass from waves of Ruppell's vultures vying for a meal. \r\n\r\nThe name marabou is thought to be derived from the Arabic word \"mur,\" meaning hermit-like. The marabou stork is unmistakable due to its size, bare head and neck, black back and white underparts. It has a huge bill, a pink gular sac at its throat, a neck ruff and black legs and wings. The species is known to be quite ill-tempered, perhaps giving rise to its colorful name.\r\n\r\n"

"Name": "Saving Rhinos with Helicopters",
"Overview": "A black rhino is moved by helicopter to a safe place to help protect it from poaching.  While it looks strange to see a rhino hanging upside down, it is a quicker mode of transportation when there are no roads to accommodate transport trucks.  The rhinos are tranquilized, blindfolded and ear plugged to minimize sensations.  While hanging them upside down may be the easiest way to transport them, scientific studies have also determined that this allows more oxygen exchange compared to hanging them in a “lying sideways” position.  But even transporting upside-down has its challenges. Here, a tranquilizer dart becomes lodged into the skin upon landing."

Their species are in steep decline, however, and are listed as endangered due to habitat loss and incidental poisonings.\r\n\r\n"

"Overview": "A pine squirrel investigates the carcass of a Norway rat as margined burying beetles crawl across the carrion during the early stages of decomposition.\r\n\r\nSquirrels, like many of their rodent relations, are surprisingly omnivorous. In addition to their familiar diet of nuts and seeds, squirrels are scavengers by nature and have been known to eat carrion. By contrast, the margined burying beetle feeds almost exclusively on decaying animals. These insects use their sensitive antennae to locate rotting flesh. Once found, they will proceed to devour the material and in some cases, cover it with the surrounding substrate, resulting in accelerated decomposition of the carcass.\r\n\r\n"

While elephants may be a threatened species in many places, some elephant populations can get too large for wildlife reserves to adequately handle.  When these populations get too big, elephants will expand their territories. This can often lead to human wildlife conflicts that can turn deadly for humans and for elephants."
