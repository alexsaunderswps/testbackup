These sounds include huffs, snorts and even a unique humming sound. These vocal behaviors play a crucial role in establishing social bonds, expressing emotions and signaling territorial or defensive intentions within their complex social dynamics."

The Falkland's sea lion population was decimated by commercial hunters. Down to to 4% of historical numbers, it has never recovered though hunting was stopped in the 1950s. One possible reason is warming local seawater temperatures, due to climate change, which may be reducing food availability and the ability of females to properly feed their nursing pups.\r\n\r\n"

"Overview": "Black vultures feeding at this nest are helping the turtle. The black vulture is a scavenger and feeds almost exclusively on carrion. They use their sharp eyes to locate food and regularly patrol beaches for dead animals washed up on shore. Where turtles are nesting, they are quick to locate nests that have been disturbed by predators. The birds are not known to harm intact nests. Cleaning up destroyed nests may help reduce infestations of fly maggots that destroy healthy intact nests.\r\n\r\nThis video was collected in collaboration with Osa Conservation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting the globally significant biodiversity of the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Studies have shown that those who shine brightest attract the most females. The color is not a pigment. It is caused by the refraction of light (as with rainbows) by highly organized cells on the outside of the scrotum. The females are using brightness as an indicator of overall genetic quality. \r\n\r\n"

All four species in the United States are at risk of contracting the disease, with prairie dogs suffering an extremely high mortality rate at or above 90 percent. Many species depend on the prairie dog's survival as it is a keystone species and an indicator of an ecosystem's overall health.\r\n\r\n"

A lion’s tongue is covered in tiny spines, which face backwards, and are used to scrape meat from bones. "

Scientists believe that healthy predator populations help maintain functioning ecosystems."

"Overview": "A marabou stork defends a kudu carcass from waves of Ruppell's vultures vying for a meal. \r\n\r\nThe name marabou is thought to be derived from the Arabic word \"mur,\" meaning hermit-like. The marabou stork is unmistakable due to its size, bare head and neck, black back and white underparts. It has a huge bill, a pink gular sac at its throat, a neck ruff and black legs and wings. The species is known to be quite ill-tempered, perhaps giving rise to its colorful name.\r\n\r\n"

"Name": "Saving Rhinos with Helicopters",
"Overview": "A black rhino is moved by helicopter to a safe place to help protect it from poaching.  While it looks strange to see a rhino hanging upside down, it is a quicker mode of transportation when there are no roads to accommodate transport trucks.  The rhinos are tranquilized, blindfolded and ear plugged to minimize sensations.  While hanging them upside down may be the easiest way to transport them, scientific studies have also determined that this allows more oxygen exchange compared to hanging them in a “lying sideways” position.  But even transporting upside-down has its challenges. Here, a tranquilizer dart becomes lodged into the skin upon landing."

"Overview": "A pine squirrel investigates the carcass of a Norway rat as margined burying beetles crawl across the carrion during the early stages of decomposition.\r\n\r\nSquirrels, like many of their rodent relations, are surprisingly omnivorous. In addition to their familiar diet of nuts and seeds, squirrels are scavengers by nature and have been known to eat carrion. By contrast, the margined burying beetle feeds almost exclusively on decaying animals. These insects use their sensitive antennae to locate rotting flesh. Once found, they will proceed to devour the material and in some cases, cover it with the surrounding substrate, resulting in accelerated decomposition of the carcass.\r\n\r\n"
