# Parallel execution with pytest-xdist (already installed):
#   -n auto           uses all available CPU cores
#   -n 2              uses exactly 2 workers (safe starting point)
#   --dist=loadfile   keeps all tests in a file on the same worker (prevents
#                     pagination/data-creation tests from interfering across workers)
# Example: pytest -m UI --browser chromium -n auto --dist=loadfile
# CI passes -n auto --dist=loadfile automatically (see .github/workflows/run-tests.yml)
